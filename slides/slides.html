# Content Security Policy

## and Its Side Effects

Webnesday 2023

Roman Ehrbar


---

# Agenda

1. Why now?
2. Why me?
3. And how?

---

# Why now?

- Increased attacks on swiss companies.
- Active attacks on our partners.
- Increased complexity of systems.
- Large attack surfaces.
- Risk reduction on critical infrastructure.

???

- Reason: increased attention due to participation in the sanction of russia.
- Ransomware attacks on Tegut 2021 and LÃ¼chinger & Schmid 2022
- One person cannot have the total overview over the entire composition.
- Large attack surfaces:
  - Deployment of new services; no decommission or lifecycle.
  - Increasing over time.
  - Handling of technical debt: keep infrastructure and code up to date.

---

# Why now?

.left-column[
## Complexity
]
.right-column[
- Does anybody know which services are currently running inside your website?
- Where are the resources located?
- Is there an A/B test suite installed? Google Tag Manager?
- Where do I send user input?
- Is there any external script loaded?
- Do you know who is in charge?
]

---

# Why now?

.left-column[
## Complexity
## Attack Surface
]
.right-column[
- Many services running.
- Few people maintaining it.
- Even less budget to maintain it properly.
]

???

- About 3500 domains discovered in company wide survey.
- For a large number no owner could be identified.
- Project thinking: No budget allotted after go-live in production.


---

# Why now?

.left-column[
## Complexity
## Attack Surface
## Compliance
]
.right-column[
- Migros Security Instructions
- Migros Security Ruleset
]

???

- Development of a security framework to reduce risks.
- MSI: Concrete instructions to tackle big issues. Performing initial gap analysis.
- MSR: Guide to specify how applications should be designed in the first place.

---

# Why me?

- Lead developer for Famigros and Migusto.
- Since 2017 working for Migros as a software developer.
- Affinity for security.
- Full stack expertise.

---

# Why me?

<img src="wantyou.jpg" alt="We need you" style="height: 30vh; float: right;">
- You know your website best.
- You have multiple ways to control it.

???

- Ops-Team could also control security, but does not know special factors and requirements.

---

# And how?

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
      content="default-src 'self';" />
```

Threats:
- Mitigating cross-site scripting
- Mitigating packet sniffing attacks (e.g. force protocol to https)

---

# Documents

- HTML, SVG, XML might be a document.
- Each has its own ways to load external content.
- E.g. Stylesheets or Fonts

---

# Directives

`default-src`: Fallback for other fetch directives.

`script-src`: Specifies valid sources for JavaScript and WebAssembly resources.

`img-src`: Specifies valid sources for images and favicons.

`media-src`: Specifies valid sources for `<audio>`, `<video>` and `<track>` elements.

`style-src`: Specifies valid sources for stylesheets.

`form-action`: Specifies URLs which can be used as the target of a form.

There are many more to explore...

---

# Directive values

`none`: Does not allow any resource to load.

`self`: Allow resources from the current origin.

`unsafe-inline`: Allow use of inline resources.

`data:` or `https:`: Allow a specific scheme.

`https://*.example.com:8443/path/to/file.js`

There are many more to explore...

---

# Examples

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' http://example.com;
                          connect-src 'none';
```

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';
  script-src 'report-sample' 'self' www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js
  'sha256-GA8+DpFnqAM/vwERTpb5zyLUaN5KnOhctfTsqWfhaUA=';
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'self';
  connect-src 'self' www.google-analytics.com stats.g.doubleclick.net;
  img-src 'self' *.googleusercontent.com *.gravatar.com;
```

---

# Effects

- Contents not listed in the policy are prevented to load by the browser.
- Embedded services might break (e.g. YouTube)
- Advertisement networks might use a lot of different domains.
- Embedded adverts might use their own CDN.
  - Lots of directives to update.
- Services might require multiple directives.
- Browser extensions might break.
- Using Google Tag Manager requires coordination.
- Response size increases (only apply to documents).
- Web Vitals will be much better ðŸ˜‰

???

Detection and Analysis will follow.

---

# Reporting

```
Report-To: { "group": "my-reports",
              "max_age": 10886400,
              "endpoints": [
                { "url": "https://endpoint.example.com" }
              ] }
Content-Security-Policy: â€¦; report-uri https://endpoint.example.com;
                            report-to my-reports
```

The `report-to` directive is only supported by newer browsers.
Keep `report-uri` to support older browsers as well.

???

Reporting will only work when set as headers.

---

# Example Report

```json
{
  "csp-report": {
    "blocked-uri": "https://dummyimage.com/300",
    "disposition": "enforce",
    "document-uri": "http://127.0.0.1:4321/",
    "effective-directive": "img-src",
    "original-policy": "default-src 'self'; report-uri http://127.0.0.1:4321/csp",
    "referrer": "",
    "status-code": 200,
    "violated-directive": "img-src"
  }
}
```

???

- Reports are useful to identify attacks on clients or misconfiguration.
- You can pinpoint to the exact location.
- Format is not standardized and might differ from each browser.

---

# Lessons Learned from Reports

- 55'214'843 reports -> 4% samples recorded due to rate limiting
- 428 domains identified
  - Advertising services
  - Added services in content production
- Domain for sale
- CSP is hard to maintain

???

Results from our run:
- Denial of service possible, as every violation will trigger a request.
- Reporting service using rate limiting to prevent DoS
- 428 identified domains
- domain for sale
- services without an owner
- services not documented at all

---

# Browser Support

- Every major browser since 10 years ago.
- Older browsers are another risk:
  - Missing vendor and security updates.
  - CSP will be ignored -> no protection of the visitor.

???
- Older browser without 
- Some features might be only supported in newer versions.
- Some features require multiple variants in parallel (e.g. reporting)
